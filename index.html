   <h2>Who we are</h2>
  <p class="blurb">
    The National Council of Women emerged in 1896 after the successful campaign for women’s suffrage. We were set up by our founding President, Kate Sheppard, and prominent leaders of NZ’s suffrage movement, to plan how to use the vote they’d just won for women. They needed to continue to build understanding and drive action to improve the lives of women.<br><br> Since then, there have been proud shifts in rights for women and gender diverse people, with involvement from many New Zealand community groups and individuals, which brings us to today, and the Gender Equal NZ movement which the National Council of Women is now leading.<br><br> are an umbrella organisation with a volunteer board and 15 branches nationwide. More than 200 organisations, as well as individuals, are members.

  <h2>What we do</h2>
  <p class="blurb">We are making equality, reality. <br><br>The National Council of Women of New Zealand’s strategic vision is a Gender Equal New Zealand. By building understanding and driving action for gender equality, we enable New Zealanders to have the freedom and opportunity to determine their own future.
    We want all New Zealanders to say, “gender is irrelevant in terms of achievement and freedom”; “all societal roles are valued in New Zealand”; “I can be whatever I want to be” and “employment supports gender equality and work/life balance”.
    At the moment all New Zealanders cannot say these things.<br><br> Our research shows that if we are to successfully achieve our vision of a gender equal New Zealand the potential impact is huge – socially, and economically. Our main projects are the Gender Attitudes Survey, and the Gender Dashboard. Our award winning national Gender Attitudes Survey, carried out with Research NZ in late 2017, has given us a snapshot of New Zealanders knowledge of, and attitudes towards gender equality. This comprehensive, ongoing survey will be repeated regularly to allow us to measure shifts in attitudes over time.
    The Gender Dashboard is where we collect, collate and analyse data to build a shared understanding of the status of all women in Aotearoa New Zealand. We work with expert partners to illustrate key areas of inequality from an intersectional perspective. <br><br>Our Briefing to Incoming Ministers November 2017 provides more information about our current work programmes and goals as at November 2017. Our white paper: Enabling Women’s Potential – the social, economic and ethical imperative, released in November 2015, provides more rationale for our work.
    we are to successfully achieve our vision of a gender equal New Zealand the potential impact is huge – socially, and economically.
